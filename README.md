## Ex-vivo canine spinal cord

In this work, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients for scan-rescan reliability and took their differences to determine if some myelin techniques  are more reliable than others.

For statistical analyses, [SPMRT](https://github.com/CPernet/spmrt) toolbox was used, which allows bootstrapped comparison of test-retest relaibility, agreement (concordance) coefficients and finally enables shift function analysis. 

The data is publicly available at [OSF](https://osf.io/gbn6r/).
